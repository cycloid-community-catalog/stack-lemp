# This script is deployed by packer during the AMI creation and executed via
# the user-data set by the ASG.
#
# It takes care of finishing the configuration of the instance by running
# various playbooks.
#  * One for the configuration of services
#  * and one for the deployment of the code.
#
# Relics from the AMI (hostname/IP addresses) etc should be removed during the
# run, to end-up with a neat image.
#
# Once the code is deployed, the instance should be ready to serve content.
#
# If anything goes wrong during this script, the instance will be shut down
# while everything should be logged into a log file to be easily debuggable.
#
# If the script runs fine it should remove everything it has used to leave a
# clean configured instance running - except the logs.
#
# N.B.: The script itself should be deleted if it ran fine.
